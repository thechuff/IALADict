# Interlingua Dictionaries (IALADict) 

This repository is designed to compile the various Interlingua dictionaries into one usable, searchable tool. It borrows from a similar project for Occidental.

Slowly but surely, we are gathering dictionary data from various sources and translating them to the open and free format of CSV.

If you'd like to create an HTML table, JSON file, or Excel sheet, just download the CSV and convert from there.

## Contributing to Dictionaries
